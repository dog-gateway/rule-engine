## Dog Rule Engine Bundle ##
Encapsulates the JBoss Drools engine (version 5.4.0) and provides a declarative language for rule definition (and execution) in Dog.

**WARNING**
This bundle currently exploits JAXB XML parsing and therefore cannot be used with Java versions greater than 8.x.x. It will be migrated to Jackson-based XML parsing to avoid such an issue.
